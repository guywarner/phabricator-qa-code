phabricator-qa-code
===================

Little script to better help QA use Phabricator

You'll need to get through the script and change things to work with your workflow.

It runs the arc command, it could probably use the conduit url.

We have it as a part of our repo, so from the root directory we run:

./app/DevTools/reviewCode.php
